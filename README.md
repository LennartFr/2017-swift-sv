# Learn to build Cognitive apps with Watson services & Swift on the Server
This is a repo for Swift on the Server Workshop in San Francisco/Silicon Valley in 2017. If you use it please give me a star - thank you!

## Preparation
Please start by signing up for Bluemix: [Bluemix.net](http://bluemix.net) (the access to the services for a trial account is free of charge for 30 days for development purposes only).

Download CLI for Cloudfoundry - [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) You run this command on your computer to interact with apps you are creating in the IBM Bluemix Cloud.

## First steps with Swift on the Server
Check out the [Swift sandbox](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/)

## Check out the Swift Package Catalog
(https://packagecatalog.com/) 

## (Optional) local Swift Server (IBM Kitura)
If you have a Mac with the Xcode 8.3.+ follow this: [kitura.io](http://www.kitura.io/)

## Swift Server as a Service on IBM Cloud
You can instantiate the Swift Server on IBM Cloud. Go to Bluemix, and create the Swfit service for KITURA: [https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/runtime-for-swift?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/runtime-for-swift?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps)

## IBM Developer Journeys with Server Side Swift
IBM has created a set of developer journeys for developers to helo them create various applications. Here is the limk to the Journeys for Server Side Swift:

## We will use this Journey for our next hands-on exercise: [https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/use-swift-interpret-unstructured-data-hacker-news/](Use Swift to interpret unstructured data from Hacker News). And see also the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/IBM/Hackernews-NLU?cm_mc_uid=12995738295115035971662&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1503602915](Use Swift to interpret unstructured data from Hacker News )
