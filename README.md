# Learn to build Cognitive apps with Watson services & Swift on the Server
This is a repo for Swift on the Server Workshop in San Francisco/Silicon Valley in 2017. If you use it please give me a star - thank you!

## Preparation
Please start by signing up for Bluemix: [Bluemix.net](http://bluemix.net) (the access to the services for a trial account is free of charge for 30 days for development purposes only). There is also a [Lite account] (https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/standard-account)

Download CLI for Cloudfoundry - [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) You run this command on your computer to interact with apps you are creating in the IBM Bluemix Cloud.

## First steps with Swift on the Server
Check out the [Swift sandbox](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/) followed by [Swift Package Catalog](https://packagecatalog.com/) 

## (Optional) local Swift Server (IBM Kitura)
If you have a Mac with the Xcode 8.3.+ follow this: [kitura.io](http://www.kitura.io/)

## Swift Server as a Service on IBM Cloud
You can launch Swift Server on IBM Cloud. Go to Bluemix, and create [the Swift service for Kitura](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/runtime-for-swift?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps)

## IBM Developer Journeys with Server Side Swift
[https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/category/swift-on-the-server/](IBM has created a set of developer journeys for developers to help them create various applications)

##  Hands-on exercise for the truly ambitious

We will use this Journey for our next hands-on exercise: [https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/use-swift-interpret-unstructured-data-hacker-news/] (Use Swift to interpret unstructured data from Hacker News). Also the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/IBM/Hackernews-NLU?cm_mc_uid=12995738295115035971662&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1503602915](Use Swift to interpret unstructured data from Hacker News )

Stretch goal: Either:
