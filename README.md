Download CLI for Cloudfoundry - [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/) You run this command on your computer to interact with apps you are creating in the IBM Bluemix Cloud.

## Lab 1 Introduction to Swift on the Server
Lab 1a): Check out the [Swift Sandbox](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/) followed by [Swift Package Catalog](https://packagecatalog.com/) 
Lab 1b): Launch Swift on the Server on the IBM Cloud. [the Swift service for Kitura](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/runtime-for-swift?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps)

## (Optional) local Swift Server (IBM Kitura)
If you have a Mac with the Xcode 8.3.+ follow this: [kitura.io](http://www.kitura.io/)

## IBM Developer Journeys with Server Side Swift
[IBM has created a set of Developer Journeys for developers to help them create various applications/](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/category/swift-on-the-server/)

## Lab 2 Use Swift to interpret unstructured data from Hacker News

We will use one of the Developer Journeys for our next hands-on exercise: [Use Swift to interpret unstructured data from Hacker News](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/use-swift-interpret-unstructured-data-hacker-news/).

## Stretch goal: For Lab 3, select one of three Developer Journeys below:
1) [Build a Swift-based mobile chatbot to provide recommendations, reservations, and event planning/](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/build-a-cognitive-recommendation-app-with-swift/), or 
2) [Build and deploy an enterprise Swift application that uses multiple services and libraries](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/build-an-enterprise-swift-app-using-services/), or 
3) [Smart picture sharing on the go/](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/apply-cognitive-to-mobile-images-on-the-go/)
