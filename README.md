# Learn to build Cognitive apps with Watson services & Swift on the Server
This is a repo for Swift on the Server Workshop in San Francisco/Silicon Valley in 2017. If you use it please give me a star - thank you!

## preparation
Please start by signing up for Bluemix: [Bluemix.net](http://bluemix.net) (the access to the services for a trial account is free of charge for 30 days for development purposes only).

Download CLI for Cloudfoundry - [CF CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases)

## first steps with Swift on the Server
Check out the [Swift sandbox](https://swift.sandbox.bluemix.net/)

## Check out the package catalog: https://packagecatalog.com/ 

## (optional) local Swift Server (IBM Kitura)
If you have a Mac with the Xcode 8.3.+ follow this: [kitura.io](http://www.kitura.io/)

## Swift Server as a Service on IBM Cloud
You can instantiate the Swift Server on IBM Cloud. Go to Bluemix, and create the Swfit service for KITURA: [https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/runtime-for-swift?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/runtime-for-swift?env_id=ibm%3Ayp%3Aus-south&taxonomyNavigation=apps)
